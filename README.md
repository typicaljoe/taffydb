# TaffyDB (taffy.js) - mmikowski fork

TaffyDB is an opensouce library that brings database features 
into your JavaScript applications.

## New versions

### 2.8.0
- Adjusted to pass jslint and employ some best practice

## 2.8.1 - updated regression tests, ported iOS9 fix from
- Updated tests to check for regressions
- Made tests easy to expand
- Added iOS9 fixes per https://github.com/typicaljoe/taffydb/pull/101/files

## Introduction

TaffyDB brings powerful SQL-like database capabilities to JavaScript,
and can greatly improve the way you with with data in your applications.
It can also greatly reduce development time and improve the speed and 
quality of your code.

How you ever noticed how JavaScript object literals look a lot like
records? And that if you wrap a group of them up in an array you have
something that acts a lot like a database table?  We did too, and 
TaffyDB provides you with a rich set of tools to manipulate lists of
objects with a fast, uniform API.

## What makes it sticky

 - Extremely fast
 - Powerful JavaScript centric data selection engine
 - Database inspired features such as insert, update, unique, count, etc
 - Robust cross browser support
 - Easily extended with your own functions
 - Compatible with any DOM library (jQuery, YUI, Dojo, etc)

## Create a DB
Just pass in a JSON array:

    var product_db = TAFFY([
      { "item"  : 1,
        "name"  : "Blue Ray Player",
        "price" : 99.99
      },
      { "item"  : 2,
        "name"  : "3D TV",
        "price" : 1799.99
      }
    ]);

## Example queries

    // where item is equal to 1
    var item1 = products({item:1});

	  // where price is less than 100
    var lowPricedItems = products({price:{lt:100}});

    // where name is like "Blue Ray"
    var blueRayPlayers = products({name:{like:"Blue Ray"}});

    // get first record
    products().first();

    // get last record
    products().last();

## Example record manipulation

    // update the price of the Blue Ray Player to 89.99
    products({item:1}).update({price:89.99});

    // loop over the records and call a function
    products().each(function (r) {alert(r.name)});

    // sort the records by price descending
    products.sort("price desc");

    // select only the item names into an array
    products().select("name"); // returns ["3D TV","Blue Ray Player"]

    // Inject values from a record into a string template.
    // Row value will be set to "<tr><td>3D TV</td><td>17999.99</td></tr>"
    var row = products({item:2}).supplant("<tr><td>{name}</td><td>{price}</td></tr>");

## Use it in Node.JS
Node is easy to use in Node.JS.  Simply install using `npm` and `require` the
package:

    TAFFY = require( 'taffy' ).taffy;

The automated regression test file `nodeunit_suite.js` is an excellent
example.

## Automated regression tests

### Purpose
TaffyDB has been used and refined for years for numerous production tools and
commercial products.  It is therefore is quite stable and reliable.  However,
we want expand our regression test coverage so we can easily improve the code
with the confidence that we are unlikely to break exising capabilities.

### Running the tests
Running the nodeunit suite is simple:

    cd taffydb
    install_dev.sh # this installs development dependencies
    bin/nodeunit ./nodeunit_suite.js

### Help us out!
We wish to substantially expand the number of tests, and your
help is certainly welcome!  The nodeunit code is quite easy to adjust, so if
you want to provide a pull request for a change, that would be welcome.
Alternately, if you just send along the code for a test scenario, we'd be
happy to include it in the suite.
