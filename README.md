# TaffyDB (taffy.js)

TaffyDB is an opensouce library that brings database features into your JavaScript applications.

## Introduction

Have you ever noticed how JavaScript object literals look a lot like records? And that if you wrap a group of them up in an array you have something that atcs a lot like a database table? TaffyDB brings powerful database funtionality to that concept and rapidly improves the way you work with data inside of JavaScript.

## What makes it sticky

 - Extremely fast
 - Powerful JavaScript centric data selection engine
 - Database inspired features such as insert, update, unique, count, etc
 - Robust cross browser support
 - Easily extended with your own functions
 - Compatible with any DOM library (jQuery, YUI, Dojo, etc)

## Create a DB

Just pass in JSON:

    var products = TAFFY([{
      "item":1,
    	"name":"Blue Ray Player",
    	"price":99.99
    }, {
        "item":2,
        name:"3D TV",
        price:1799.99
    }]);


## Find data

Use JSON to compare:

    var item1 = products({item:1});
    // where item is equal to 1
    var lowPricedItems = products({price:{lt:100}});
	// where price is less than 100
	var blueRayPlayers = products({name:{like:"Blue Ray"}});
	// where name is like "Blue Ray"

## Use data

    // update the price of the Blue Ray Player to 89.99
    products({item:1}).update({price:89.99});
    // loop over the records and call a function
    products().each(function (r) {alert(r.name)});
    // get first record
    products().first();
    // get last record
    products().last();
    // sort the records by price descending
    products.sort("price desc");
    // select only the item names into an array
    products().select("name"); // returns ["3D TV","Blue Ray Player"]
    // inject values from a record into a string template
    var row = products({item:2}).supplant("<tr><td>{name}</td><td>{price}</td></tr>");
    // row now equal to "<tr><td>3D TV</td><td>17999.99</td></tr>"
